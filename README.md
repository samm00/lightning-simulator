# Lightning Simulator

This is a quick lightning simulator I put together. It utilizes controlled, biased Rapidly Exploring Random Trees to simulate lightning strikes.

This code utilizes the ruby gem `ruby2d`. 

The graphics are a work in progress.

This gif was recorded in poor quality due to the recording software used, it should run smoother on its own.
